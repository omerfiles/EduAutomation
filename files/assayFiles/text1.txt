If some Russian invites you in his/her dinner you should be just a polite person, without showing off in any displays – in dress, in behaviour etc. Regarding to dressing, it is always better to know in advance the requirements of the dress code, but usually for family parties casual and customary suits are available. Well-mannered guest will prepare beforehand some small presents for small children of the hosts. Or if they are close people it is possible to give some souvenirs from your country to the whole family. You shouldn't arrive on time, it is better to arrive five minutes later, because this additional time could help hosts to finish their preparation in case of dragging out. If during your dinner you refuse second help, it wouldn't mean some exaggeration, just specify that you are already full. Host good manners in their turn include courtesy and hospitality for guests, but they should't disturb or hurt the guest. Being polite means being welcoming, but not make person do what he does not want.
