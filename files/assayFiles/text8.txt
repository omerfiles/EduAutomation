Of corse, there are also some good manners for guests in our country. But it seems to me, these manners aren't very complicated and strict, because people aren't so sensitive to it in my country. For example, if I am invited in my friend's family, I may arrive a little early, on time or a little late, it isn't very important. Although, it isn't recommended to arrive too early or too late. It is customary to bring a sweet gift for the tea ceremony, it is considered a rule of courtesy. But actually, if I visit my very close friend, especially if we often meet each other, in this case I can bring a gift or come without any gift - it will be o'key.   During the dinner it is quite acceptable to refuse certain food. Moreover, sometimes it is even recommended to do. I'll try to explain it with the help of some examples. If the hostess propose you to taste one or two plates, you may taste all or refuse only one of them, NOT ALL! And if the table is served with a wide choice of different plates, so, you shouldn't eat everything you see. In order to be considered a well-mannered person, it would be better to refuse some dishes, because nobody mustn't think that you are hungry even if you are :) When the dinner is over, you must thank for it.   As for the clothes, there are no any recommendations concerning it. You can be dressed in your usual clothes in which you come out. But of corse it mustn't be vulgar.   So, in my opinion, these are the main rules of how you should behave when you are invited to dinner in an ordinary russian family. <B
