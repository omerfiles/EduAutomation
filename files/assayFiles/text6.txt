In my country, when someone invites you to dinner, we consider a good detail if you bring a gift allthough if it is not a must. It is preferable you arrive on time too. We respect all tastes therefore there is no problem if you don't like something and refuse certain food. There is no restriction on clothing, you have only to bear in mind to dress according to the occasion or the place you are going to dinner.<B
