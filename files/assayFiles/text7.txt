Some examples of good manners for guests in my country could be: offering your help to guide them to some place they want to visit, asking them what they want to eat, offering the personal bed to sleep instead of the sofa.    Well, you shouldn't bring a gift. I mean it's not compulsory, and anybody will consider it impolite. However it will be fine and welcome if you do it.    In Spain is very common if you are late on a date, but in my case I usually get very nervous if somebody arrives late, so I would say it's polite to be on time in every date, although it depends on the importance of the date.    Refusing food is generally impolite, but if there is a confident atmosphere you can tell a good excuse and refusing it if you don't like it.    I supose that your dressing way depends of your style and the situation. But it could be considered as impolite to dress an informal dress in a formal place or situation.    If someone invited me to dinner I would taste every food they offer me, but I wouldn't eat too much or too fast, just the normal quantity and pace. My body position must be erect. I would be the last person leaving the table and, in the end, I would express my satisfaction about the dinner.<B
