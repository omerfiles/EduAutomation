Russia is the biggest country in the world and its geographical, climatic and cultural diversity is just amazing! The territory is so big that it includes several time zones and travelling by train from the west to the east may take over a fortnight. The country cannot be referred to either Europe or Asia as in the west it borders Finland and the Baltic states, whereas in the east it borders China.   As for the climate, it ranges from dry deserts in the south, where the temperature can reach +50 degrees Centigrade, to eternal ice and snow in the north where it can get as cold as  -60 degrees.  Originally, the Russian state began in Kiev, which is currently the capital of Ukraine. Gradually more and more territories were conquered and the capital was moved to Moscow. Peter the Great, the first Russian emperor, had a lot of successful wars and, as a result, vast territories were added to Russia both in the west and in the east. The peoples living in these territories brought their languages and traditions, thereby enriching the Russian culture. Nowadays there are over a hundred different ethnicities living in the Russian Federation. However, the population of Russia is not very dense taking into account its territory. The census held in 2011 showed that at present there are about 140 million people living in the country. About 12 million in Moscow and 6 million populate St. Petersburg, the second biggest city. Some people say, though, it is the most beautiful city in the world. St. Petesburg was named after Peter the Great who actually founded it. The city is famous for its wide streets, canals, bridges and white nights. Also it is considered to be the cultural capital of the country with all its museums, palaces, art galleries, etc.  Russian people may look a bit gloomy, but in fact they are quite hospitable and always ready to laugh.   Russia is an astounding country and everyone should visit it!    <B
