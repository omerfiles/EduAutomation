I feel sure that you will be interested to know what the reasons are caused this huge walkout at the plant.  First of all I would say that approximately five years ago our plant for the first time faced global financial problems. Perhaps it was connected with the 2007-08 financial Crisis all around the world. The financial difficulties at once affected on our low wages. We had been asked about wage cuts and we agreed. We were quite loyal to the plant. In addition to the decrease in wages we faced some problems as increase duties and responsibilities of every laborer and sometimes we had to work overtime. The result of this was unfair dismissal of plant’s workers in case if someone didn’t handle his job well.  Besides this we were also canceled severance pay, social benefits package. Moreover the working conditions got worse: the working day became in an hour longer and a lunch break was shortened.    For these last years the management has been trying to resolve the problem and we trusted them… They deceived us. They did nothing for us. We are so annoyed to hear time and again their promises about good changes in the future. We’ve decided to go on strike. We hope that our management at last pays its attention to the main people at the plant, its workers and technicians who try to save the steel industry in the region.   We suppose that all current problems can be resolved. We have to export our steel abroad and start cooperating with new foreign countries. The management took a wrong position to blame bad changes at the plant on foreign competition and its cheaper production. We believe that high quality of our steel can be appreciated by our new clients. The marketing department has to change its business strategy.                                                                                                                                         Hank Wiskowski                                                      Dep. Of Steel Industry                                                                Flemming Steel  <B
